From there, you
should see three (3) links under the "Your Account" heading. Click
"create an organization".

If you are already logged in, you can also go directly to
[the token website][https://www.npmjs.com/org/create](https://www.npmjs.com/org/create).

## 3. Name Your Organization and Choose Your Plan

Give your Organization a name! Choose wisely, as changing your Organization
is complicated and requires [contacting npm Support]. 
[Learn more about renaming and/or deleting your Organization].

*Would you like to convert your current user account to an Organization?
Want to use your current user scope as an Organization scope?
[Learn more about migrating a user account].*

Once you've named your Organization, you'll need to choose a plan.
Currently, npm offers 2 plans:

  - **Free**: public packages only.
  - **Paid**: install and publish **private packages** ($7/user/month).

For example, if you have 3 users, an Organization that only needs public 
packages will be entirely free. However, if your Organization needs to
install and publish **private packages**, it will cost $21/month 
($7/month*3 users).

**You can change your plan any time through the billing panel.** For
more information on the features of each plan, visit our [pricing page].

Once you have chosen your plan, click the big red "Create an Organization"
button.

## 4. Enter Payment Information (paid Orgs only)

If you chose an Organization with access to private packages, clicking the
big red "Create an Organization" button will bring up a Stripe Payments
prompt. Enter the email address you'd like associated with billing (this
does *not* have to match the owner's email), as well as billing address
and credit card information.

**You can change your billing info at anytime through your Organization's
billing page.**

Your credit card will be immediately billed $7 for a single user, the
account of the person creating the Organization. 


## 5. Add Members to your Organization

Now that you've created your Organization, you are given the ability to add
members. You can add members to your Organization at any time, so feel free
to skip this step if you aren't ready to add users yet.

The user who created the Organization is:

- Automatically assigned the **role** of **Owner**. 
  [Learn more about Roles and Privileges].
- Automatically added to a **team** called **Developers**. 
  [Learn more about the Developers team].

To add users to your Organization, enter their npm username into the text
input and click the red button that says "Invite". If you chose an
Organization with private package access, every user will add an 
additional $7/month to your bill.

**When you add a member to your Organization they are immediately added. They
do not receive an email, so please let your new members know that you have added
them.**

All the users you add from this interface are:

- Automatically assigned the **role** of **Member**
  [Learn more about Roles and Privileges].
- Automatically added to a **team** called **Developers**
  [Learn more about the Developers Team].

If the person you would like to add to your Organization does not have an
npm username, they'll need to create an npm user account. You can send them
[this link][1] to sign up.
