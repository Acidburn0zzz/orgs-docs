# Upgrading and Downgrading

will also explain the implications of these actions for your package access and
billing.

## Downgrading to a Free Org from a Paid Org

If you currently have an Organization with a private packages plan but no longer
want the plan, you can Downgrade Your Account.

Not sure if you want to downgrade? ([Learn more about the plans we offer]).

To downgrade your organization, locate the "Downgrade" panel on the "payment info"
tab for your Organization. This panel will let you know when your publish/install
access to your Private Packages will end. This usually coincides with the day your
next billing period would have begun.

Click the "Downgrade your Plan" button. You will be brought to a page confirming
your decision to downgrade your Organization. Click the "Downgrade to a Free 
Organization" button to downgrade your account. You will be brought back to your
payment info tab.

You can verify that the Downgrade was successful by locating the "Monthly Bill" panel
on your Organization's "payment info" tab. Your bill should now read $0.

If you run into any trouble with this process, you should [contact npm support].
