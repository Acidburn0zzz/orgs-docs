# Managing Members

This page will explain how to manage **Members** of your Organization. It
will also explain how to manage the **Roles** of those Members.

You will need to have the **Owner** Role to perform this work. For more
information on **Roles**, check out the [Roles and Privileges doc].

<hr/>

To manage the members of your Organization, navigate to your Organizations
landing page. You can find it at `https://www.npmjs.com/org/<org_name>`.

Once you are on your Organization's landing page, click the "Members" tab.
You can also just point your browser at 
`https://www.npmjs.com/org/<org_name>/members`.

## Adding Members

To add a member:

1. Make sure the new member has an npm user account. If they don't, have them
  [signup here].
2. Enter the new member's npm username.
3. Select the **Role** you would like the new member to have.
  ([Learn more about Roles and Privileges]).
4. Click "Add Member".

### Notes:

- Adding an npm user as a Member to an Organization does *not* send that
  user an email. You should tell your new team members that you have 
  added them!
- All Members are automatically added to the Developers Team 
([Learn more about the Developers Team]).
- You might want to manage the teams this Member belongs to.
([Learn more about Managing Teams]). 

## Changing a Member's Role

To change a **Member's Role**:

1. Locate the **Member** in the list of members 
2. Select the **Role** you would like to update the **Member** to
3. The dropdown will immediately appear inactive/greyed out when you release the
  dropdown, indicating that your update request is being processed. When the update
  request has been processed, the dropdown will become active again and a message will
  appear with the status of the update. This should take less than a second.

## Deleting a Member

To delete a member:

1. Locate the **Member** in the list of members
2. Click the white X in the grey circle at the far right of the row
3. The page will refresh. You should see a message telling you the status of your
  delete request. If your delete request was successful, you should no longer see
  the member you deleted in the list of members.

### Notes:

- Removing a Member from an Organization does *not* send that user an email. You
  should tell this user that they are no longer a member of your Organization.
